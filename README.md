# collision avoidence system
An Accident Detection System using an ultrasonic sensor, LED pins, buzzer, and Arduino is designed to detect collisions or sudden obstacles in front of a vehicle or object. The system typically works as follows:

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): Measures the distance between the vehicle and an obstacle. If the distance suddenly drops below a threshold, it indicates a possible collision.

Arduino: Acts as the central controller, processing the sensor data and triggering alerts.

LED Pins: Provide a visual indication of danger (e.g., a red LED blinking when an obstacle is detected).

Buzzer: Emits an audible warning when an accident or potential collision is detected.

This system is useful for collision avoidance and can be integrated into smart vehicles or robotics to enhance safety.
